        <p> <b>Example 1 </b> In Fig 12.3, if P is (2,4,5), find the coordinates of F.</p>
        <p><b>Solution</b> For the point F, the distance measured along OY is zero. Therefore, the
            coordinates of F are (2,0,5).</p>
        <p><b>Example 2</b> Find the octant in which the points (–3,1,2) and (–3,1,– 2) lie.</p>
        <p><b>Solution</b> From the Table 12.1, the point (–3,1, 2) lies in second octant and the point
            (–3, 1, – 2) lies in octant VI.</p>

                    <p>We have studied about the distance between two points in two-dimensional coordinate system. Let us now extend this study to three-dimensional system.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>Let P <tt>(x <sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>)</tt> and Q <tt>(x <sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>)</tt> be two points referred to a system of rectangular axes OX, OY and OZ. Through the points P and Q draw planes parallel to the coordinate planes so as to form a rectangular parallelopiped with one diagonal PQ (Fig 12.4).
